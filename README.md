# #Pandas Challenge - Heroes of Pymoli

Heroes of Pymoli is a fantasy game that, like many others in its genre, is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. The goal of the project was to clean and organize the data using Pandas to answer some specific questions about gamer buying patterns and demographics that can help drive strategic decisions in other areas of the business like marketing.

# # Questions

1. Player Count - What is the total player count? How many are male vs. female?
2. Age Demograhics - What are the peak age demographics?
3. Purchasing Analysis by Gender - Do females or males spend more on average?
4. Popular Items - Which items are sold the most?
5. Profitable Items - Which items account for highest total revenue?
